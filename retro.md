# Sprint 1 retrospective notes

The first sprint retrospective was held in the evening after the customer meeting and demo. The retrospective was held over Discord due to time constraints, although the team agreed that meeting face-to-face would be preferable. The Glad, Sad, Mad icebreaker was used. Points that were raised were:

**Glad:**
- All user stories were completed successfully.
- Communication was active on Discord.

**Sad:**
- The team agreed that there wasn’t enough to do for everyone. Many tasks, such as things to do with configuration, were dependent of eachother, making it difficult to divide tasks evenly and give everyone a chance to contribute.
- Some tasks should have been written more clearly.
- The team relied too heavily on someone to be the leader and other members should have taken more initiative.
- The team agreed that meeting face-to-face would boost productivity, communication and the quality of the product, but this would be challenging due to some team members having long commutes. Pair programming was also suggested.
- Unpreparedness for the customer meeting.

**Mad:**
- There was some confusion over whether a certain task had been started or not because the product backlog didn’t have a ”Not started” state.

**Measures for improvement (kehitystoimenpide):**
- Let’s aim to work together more, face-to-face or in a Discord call.
- Let’s define tasks more clearly and make sure they’re more independent of eachother.
- Everyone gets their own user story to work on for starters.

As a result of the retrospective a team member was assigned to be in charge of each
- Tests (Robot and unit) and coverage
- Layout
- Product and sprint backlogs
- README file

Although multiple people would be working on e.g. tests and backlogs, these roles were assigned to ensure that everything gets done and everything is properly maintained. The retrospective also gave us a better idea of how to improve working as a team.
